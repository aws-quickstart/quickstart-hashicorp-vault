== Predeployment steps

=== Specialized knowledge

Before you deploy this Quick Start, become familiar with the
following AWS services. If you are new to AWS, see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gettingstarted/latest/awsgsg-intro/intro.html[Getting Started with AWS^].

* http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/vpc/[Amazon VPC^]

* https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/autoscaling/[Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling^]

Note: The Center for Internet Security (CIS) Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS is available as an optional, hardened AMI type. The image of Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS is preconfigured by CIS according to their benchmark recommendations. For more information, see https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B078TPPXV2?qid=1588650469654[CIS Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS Benchmark — Level 1^].

=== Prepare an AWS account

1. If you don’t already have an AWS account, create one at http://aws.amazon.com by following the on-screen instructions.

2. Use the selector in the navigation bar to choose the AWS Region where you want to deploy {partner-product-name} on AWS.

3. Create a http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html[key pair^] in your preferred Region. If necessary, request a service quota increase for the Amazon EC2 *t3.medium* and *m5.large* instance types. You might need to request an increase if you already have an existing deployment that uses this instance type, and you think you might exceed the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html[default quota^] with this reference deployment.
