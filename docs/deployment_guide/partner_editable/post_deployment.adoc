// Include any postdeployment steps here, such as steps necessary to test that the deployment was successful. If there are no postdeployment steps, leave this file empty.

== Postdeployment steps

=== Verify successful deployment

You can use the URL displayed in the *Outputs* tab for the stack to view the resources that were created.

=== Review audit logs

This Quick Start is configured to ship {partner-product-short-name} audit logs to Amazon CloudWatch. To see your logs, open the https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/[Amazon CloudWatch console^]. In the navigation pane, choose *Logs*, and then select *{partner-product-short-name}-Audit-Logs-XXXX* value from the *Outputs* section. You will see a screen that is similar to <<auditlogs>>.

=== Test the deployment

To access the {partner-product-short-name} server cluster environment, access the Application Load Balancer endpoint that was created during the deployment.

[start=1]
. Locate the AWS Secrets Manager secret from the *Outputs* tab. The secret contains the {partner-product-short-name} root token and recovery secrets for {partner-product-short-name}.

[start=3]
. Use your preferred web browser to open the URL. On the {partner-product-short-name} server login screen, use the root token from AWS Secrets Manager to log in to the {partner-product-short-name} server cluster.

Note: Ensure that you have network access to this address. Specifically, for internal load balancers, you must configure the VPC to allow this.

=== Get started with {partner-product-name}

To integrate {partner-product-short-name} with your environment and get started, see the https://www.vaultproject.io/intro/getting-started[Getting Started^] section of the {partner-product-name} website.

==== Deploy {partner-product-short-name} with a CIS Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS–hardened AMI

The CIS AMI for Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS is available as an optional, hardened AMI type. The image of Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS is preconfigured by CIS according to their benchmark recommendations. For more information, see https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B078TPPXV2?qid=1588650469654[CIS Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS Benchmark — Level 1^].

==== Deploy {partner-product-short-name} with Raft-integrated storage

https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/internals/integrated-storage[Raft consensus algorithm^] is enabled by default. Using Raft as a storage backend eliminates reliance on any third-party systems, and it implements high availability, supports enterprise replication features, and provides backup/restore workflows. For more information, see the following HashiCorp pages.

==== Manage {partner-product-short-name} Agent using AWS Auth method

https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/aws[AWS Auth method^] is available as an optional Auth method in the deployment wizard. The AWS Auth method provides an automated mechanism to retrieve a Vault token for IAM principals and Amazon EC2 instances. For more information, see https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault/identity-access-management/vault-agent-aws[Vault Agent with AWS^].

==== Manage {partner-product-short-name} Agent using Kubernetes Auth method

https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/kubernetes[Kubernetes Auth method^] is an option in the deployment wizard. The Kubernetes Auth method can be used to authenticate with {partner-product-short-name} using a Kubernetes service account token. For more information, see https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault/identity-access-management/vault-agent-k8s[Vault Agent with Kubernetes^].

====  Manage {partner-product-short-name} Auto Unseal using AWS KMS

https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/seal#auto-unseal[Vault Auto Unseal^] was developed to aid in reducing the operational complexity of keeping the master key secure. For more information, see https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault/operations/ops-autounseal-aws-kms[Auto Unseal using AWS KMS^].
