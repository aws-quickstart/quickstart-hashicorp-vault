.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/hashicorp-vault-architecture-diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Quick Start sets up the following:

* A VPC with public and private subnets across three Availability Zones.

* An internet gateway to provide access to the internet.*

* A certificate from the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), assuming that the supplied hosted-zone ID and DNS name are associated with the Application Load Balancer.

* An Application Load Balancer that can either be internal or external facing.

* In the public subnets:

    ** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources.

    ** A Linux bastion host to allow inbound Secure Shell (SSH) access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances.

* In the private subnets:

    ** Auto Scaling groups that contain three, five, or seven {partner-product-name} server instances across three Availability Zones.

    ** A {partner-product-name} environment with a Raft storage backend. {partner-product-short-name} uses the Raft consensus algorithm to replicate data across the cluster.

* An AWS Secrets Manager secret that contains the root token and unseal keys created during the {partner-product-name} cluster initialization.

* An AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key that is used to auto-unseal {partner-product-name} as well as encrypt the AWS Secrets Manager secret.
